## Overview
FLtalk is a low-code/no-code framework built on IoTtalk to enable privacy-preserving federated learning for smart homes.  
It allows gesture-based appliance control using smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope data, without sharing raw data.

## Key Features
- One-shot federated learning with IoTtalk.
- Privacy-preserving gesture recognition.
- Lightweight logistic regression model for IoT devices.
- Based on IoTtalkâ€™s Dummy Device concept.
